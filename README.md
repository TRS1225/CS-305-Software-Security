# CS-305-Software-Security

# Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a company client of my employer who was seeking to enhance certain security features of their web based services. They wanted expertise on how to protect its their customer data and financial information. Specifically, the client wanted to add a file verification step to its web application to ensure secure communications.


# What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I correctly identified which cryptographic hash function would be appropriate for this application. It is important to code securely because without secure code, the system will not function properly. Software security is essential for every company which offers a web based service because without it, the company's online presence is open to attack and corruption by outside forces.


# Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Researching and implementing the appropriate cipher in Eclipse was the most challenging aspect.


# How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

In various ways, but primarily by upgrading the code to HTTPS and running OWASP Dependency Checks to eliminate vulnerabilities in third-party plug-ins. I will continue to utilize OWASP Dependency Checks until I learn of a better tool in the future.


# How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I made sure the code was functional and secure by properly running the program and reading the results in the console. After refactoring the code, I read the Dependency Check file to check on new vulnerabilities.


# What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The most helpful resources were in the weekly modules "Resources" section, as well as the class's assigned reading material.


# Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Employers may look favorably upon the complete list of vulnerabilites, descriptions and solutions which were listed, as well as the section dedicated to mitigating those dependencies.
